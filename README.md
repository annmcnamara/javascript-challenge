# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

 `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports to could to prove extra-terrestial activity! This exercise puts this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

This code that creates a table dynamically based upon a [dataset](/UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js). 

Users can also filter the table data for specific values. The project uses pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js 

## Task

### Repository Structures

1. Two folders to correspond to the challenges: **UFO-level-1** and **UFO-level-2**.

2.  **html** files are in these folders as well as the static folder containing your javascript. This is the main script to run for analysis.


### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* **UFO-level-1** contains a basic HTML web page was built, and is saved at [index.html](/UFO-level-1/index.html) 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, code was developed that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * The columns are `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* A date form is provided in the HTML document.  JavaScript code that listens for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Using multiple `input` tags, JavaScript code was developed to allow the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
